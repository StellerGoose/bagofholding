                Ingredients
                <ul>
                    <li>3 cups jasmine rice, leftovers work well</li>
                    <li>4 cups pork or chicken stock, unsalted is best</li>
                    <li>1 tbs soy sauce</li>
                    <li>2 tsp fish sauce</li>
                    <li>ground white pepper, to taste</li>
                    <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
                    <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
                    <li>1 tbs grated ginger, or more to taste</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp seasame oil</li>
                    <li>ground pork or chicken meatballs, optional</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="instructions">
                Instructions
                <ol>
                    <li>If the rice is chilled, microwave it for a minute so it's hot, which will help it absorb liquid
                        more readily.</li>
                    <li>Add rice to blender along with just enough of the stock to blend. Blend the rice briefly
                        (several seconds) until you have your desired consistency—this could be coarser or finer
                        depending on your preference, but make sure not to over-blend, you don't want a smooth puree.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pour blended rice into a heavy-bottomed pot, then use the remaining stock to rinse out the
                        blender so you get everything out and add to the pot.</li>
                    <li>Add soy sauce, fish sauce, white pepper, and garlic while bringing rice to a simmer.</li>
                    <li>Simmer for at least 10 minutes, or up to 20 minutes. The longer you simmer, the softer and
                        smoother the texture will be, but for a “quick” version, I find that 10 minutes will do just
                        fine. Once the rice starts to thicken up, stir frequently with a rubber spatula to prevent the
                        bottom from sticking to the pot.</li>
                    <li>When rice is done, add meatballs (if you have them) directly into the rice using 2 teaspoons.
                        Cook the meatballs for about 3 minutes until done.</li>
                    <li>Add your ginger, half the green onions, and the seasame oil. Taste and adjust to your liking
                    </li>
                    <li>Serve with the remaining green onions and extra white pepper if desired.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>
            <section class="notes">
                Notes
                <ul>
                    <li>If you want to add eggs, you can poach eggs separately and add it to the congee when serving. Or
                        if you want the eggs mixed in, you can crack the eggs right into the congee, let them poach
                        submerged in the congee for 3-4 minutes to firm up the whites slightly, then stir it up to mix
                        into the congee.</li>
                    <li>You do not actually have to blend the rice at all, but if you use whole rice it'll take longer
                        to break down in the pot.</li>

                        <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F.</li>

                        <li>Bake, uncovered, for 35-40 minutes. (Bake until the cheese is golden and looks like it's
                            about to fall apart).</li>
                        <li>Meanwhile, cook pasta of choice according to package directions. Save some pasta water to

                        Instructions
                        <ol>
                            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
                            <li>In a medium-sized bowl, combine oats, flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
                            <li>With a hand mixer or stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter, brown
                                sugar and honey for 1-2 minutes, until smooth and creamy. Add egg and vanilla and beat
                                to combine.</li>
                            <li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and beat until combined. Stir in 1¼ cup
                                of trail mix.</li>
                            <li>Scoop the dough into 2-tablespoon balls and place a couple inches apart on the baking
                                sheets (the dough will be sticky). If the dough is too sticky you can chill it in the
                                refrigerator for 30 minutes. Use the remaining ¼ cup trail mix to press some pieces onto
                                the top of each dough ball (this makes the trail mix more visible and makes for a
                                prettier cookie).</li>
                            <li>Bake for 8-10 minutes, until the edges of the cookies are golden brown and the very
                                center is still slightly underdone. Do not over bake, as they will finish cooking on the
                                baking sheet. Place the baking sheets on wire racks and allow the cookies to cool
                                completely.</li>

                            <li>For thicker cookies leave the dough balls in mounds. For thinner cookies (pictured),
                                lightly press down on the dough mounds before baking.</li>
                            <li>Under bake the cookies. You should remove these cookies from the oven when they are just
                                starting to turn light golden brown around the edges but they are still undercooked in
                                the center. They should be so soft that you cannot pick them up off the baking sheet
                                without them falling apart.</li>
                            <li>Wal-mart has the best trail mix for these, in the yellow bag.</li>

                        <li>Microwaving your egg too quickly or for too long can cause the yolk to explode. If you're really not sure of the strength of your microwave, err on the side of caution and microwave in 20 second intervals to start. Additionally, you can pierce the yolk with a toothpick gently under the water. </li>
                        <li>Adjust microwave time for your own microwave and doneness preference. Start at 50 seconds for a runny egg</li>
                        <li>Drain on paper towel before adding to a sandwich.</li>
